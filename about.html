          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>
            I hold a bachelor's and master's degree in Physics from the
            Universidade Estadual de Londrina (UEL) and began my doctoral
            studies at the Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP), which were
            interrupted due to health issues related to the pandemic. Currently,
            I am a resident in the Artificial Intelligence program at SENAI's
            Artificial Intelligence HUB and am transitioning to the field of
            data science.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have always had a strong interest in programming and am in the
            process of improving my skills in this area. Additionally, I possess
            a high learning capacity, allowing me to learn quickly and
            efficiently. My resume highlights my ability to bring academic
            mathematical tools and high-level critical thinking to the analysis
            and problem-solving of data science and its branches. My motivation
            primarily comes from curiosity and the pursuit of a deep
            understanding of questions before presenting answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            At present, I am focused on learning Python, but I also dedicate my
            free time to studying HTML/CSS/JS and developing web applications,
            using technologies such as Dash, Flask, and Django. Thanks to my
            solid background in statistical mathematics, particularly in the
            area of theoretical physics, and my innate interest in programming,
            data science emerged as a highly compatible field with my skills and
            knowledge. Furthermore, I aim to expand my expertise and abilities
            as a developer by learning other technologies and tools.
